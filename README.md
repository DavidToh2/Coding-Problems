Solutions to various Competitive Programming-style problems I attempted.

`make new` to start a new problem.

`make make` to compile code (to `a.out`).

`make run` to compile and run code. Note that this calls on `make make`.

Manually copy code over to desired location once done.

`make clean` to delete output files.
